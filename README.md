2. CSC 6110_assignment2_kc.pdf -Its about software build and testing. I have identified common reasons for any of the 10 failed test cases and what can be done to fix those test cases.
3. CSC 6110_HW_StaticAnalysis_KC- This file consist analysis of 10 violations. 
                                  Which further consist the name and line where violation occurs,
                                  What it is about,
